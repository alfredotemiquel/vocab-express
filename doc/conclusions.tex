In this paper we have presented our ongoing work for exploring the vocabulary used in an RDF dataset. The tool provides a clear picture of the vocabulary and how it is actually used in the dataset. As future work we want to evaluate the performance of the tool, comparing it against approaches not implemented in \emph{node.js}. Moreover, we will improve how the information is displayed to the user.
