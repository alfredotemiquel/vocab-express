In this paper we have presented our ongoing work for exploring the vocabulary of an RDF dataset. The tool provides a clear picture of the vocabulary used to model the resources of the dataset and how it is actually used.

As future work we want to evaluate the performance of the tool comparing with approaches not implemented in nodejs. Moreover, we will improve how the information is displayed to the user.
